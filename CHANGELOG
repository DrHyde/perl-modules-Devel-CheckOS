                          aren't particularly consistent

1.71    2013-01-27      Bugfix, better tests for negative assertions,

1.64    2011-04-25      Add support for GNU/kFreeBSD

1.63    2010-05-29      $^O for VOS is sometimes VOS, sometimes vos;
                        VOS supports POSIX shell redirections

1.62    2010-05-21      Add OS X 10.5 platform and EBCDIC family

1.61    2009-04-25      Better code coverage in tests;
                        Fix bug in script - not copying all members of
                          a family, only those it checked up until the
                          OS it's running on

1.6     2009-04-21      Only ask to confirm what this platform is in
                          Makefile.PL if AUTOMATED_TESTING is set;
                        Add MidnightBSD

1.55    2009-04-16      This time with the damned changes - really
                          shouldn't be doing releases at 1 am :-)

1.54    2009-04-16      And more irritating little changes, this time
                          to make tests pass on 5.6.2

1.53    2009-04-15      Grargh!  5.10.0 doesn't fully populate %INC
                          if a module dies when we use() it. HATE.
                          So need another way to find the files in the
                          scripts.  Grr. Hate. Kill.

1.52    2009-04-15      Scalar context bug fixed in script, thanks to
                          Mike Kelly
                        Tests and misc fixes for script

1.51    2009-04-14      OS "families" can tell you what their members are;
                        Update Extending.pod to explain that

1.50    2008-11-11      No bugs found in 1.49_01, bumping to 1.50
                        The "shrill demented choirs of wailing shells"
                          release

1.49_01 2008-11-05      add Haiku (thanks to Ingo Weinhold)
                        BeOS has a POSIXish shell
                        Makefile.PL can now explain what some of the
                          OSes and OS families are (thanks to Michael
                          Schwern for suggesting it)
                        The "only honest man to ever enter parliament"
                          release

                          (thanks to Matt Kraai)
                        add Realtime family
                        doco about families
                        add licence text files
                        families now use documented interface instead
                          of embedding $^O values all over the place

1.44    2008-09-26      add D::A::MirOSBSD ($^O eq 'mirbsd')

1.43    2008-03-12      use-devel-assertos now prints some status updates;
                        Break up 'package Devel::CheckLib' in inc/ so
                          distributions including it don't get marked
                          as 'unauthorised'

1.42    2007-11-20      Applied Seth Blumberg's patch to make
                          list_platforms work on not-Unix;
                        Documented that ...::OSFeatures::* is reserved;
                        Added D::A::OSFeatures::POSIXShellRedirection

1.41    2007-11-07      Aaargh, fixed broken Makefile.PL

1.2     2007-10-14      Made prompts in Makefile.PL clearer;
                        Added use-devel-assertos script;
                        Makefile.PL now requires 5.005 instead of use

1.1     2007-10-04      Oops, forgot to 'use Exporter'!

1.0     2007-10-02      Remove File::Spec::Functions;
                        Test that we can load the OSes we detected.
                          This is totally paranoid cos we already
                          did it in Makefile.PL to detect them, but
                          mumble mumble case insensitve mumble
