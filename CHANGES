1.43    2008-03-12      use-devel-assertos now prints some status updates;
                        Break up 'package Devel::CheckLib' in inc/ so
                          distributions including it don't get marked
                          as 'unauthorised'

1.42    2007-11-20      Applied Seth Blumberg's patch to make
                          list_platforms work on not-Unix;
                        Documented that ...::OSFeatures::* is reserved;
                        Added D::A::OSFeatures::POSIXShellRedirection

                          This is totally paranoid cos we already
                          did it in Makefile.PL to detect them, but
                          mumble mumble case insensitve mumble
