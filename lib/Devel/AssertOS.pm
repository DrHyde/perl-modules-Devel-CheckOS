=head1 NAME

Devel::AssertOS - require that we are running on a particular OS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Devel::AssertOS is a utility module for Devel::CheckOS and
Devel::AssertOS::*.  It is nothing but a magic C<import()> that lets you
do this:

    use Devel::AssertOS qw(Linux FreeBSD Cygwin);

which will die unless the platform the code is running on is Linux, FreeBSD
or Cygwin.

To assert that the OS is B<not> a specific platform, prepend the platform name
with a minus sign. For example, to run on anything but Amiga, do:

    use Devel::AssertOS qw(-Amiga);


=cut

sub import {
    shift;
    die("Devel::AssertOS needs at least one parameter\n") unless(@_);

    my @oses = @_;

    my ( @must, @must_not );

    for my $os ( @oses ) {
        if ( $os =~ s/^-// ) {
            push @must_not, $os;
        }
        else {
            push @must, $os;
        }
    }

    Devel::CheckOS::die_if_os_is(@must_not) if @must_not;
    Devel::CheckOS::die_if_os_isnt(@must)   if @must;
}

=head1 BUGS and FEEDBACK

I welcome feedback about my code, including constructive criticism.
Bug reports should be made using L<https://github.com/DrHyde/perl-modules-Devel-CheckOS/issues>.

You will need to include in your bug report the exact value of $^O, what
the OS is called (eg Windows Vista 64 bit Ultimate Home Edition), and,
if relevant, what "OS family" it should be in and who wrote it.

If you are feeling particularly generous you can encourage me in my
open source endeavours by buying me something from my wishlist:
